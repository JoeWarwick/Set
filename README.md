AVL tree 

A self-balancing Binary Tree. 

O(log(n)) retrieval of data point for very large data sets. 

Unlike Map there wont be collisions or resizing issues. 

Databases like SQL Server use this type of data structure on colliding indexes to retrieve the value quickly.

Data can be streamed to it.

REASON: I needed one for a few projects and dotnet does not have one so I built this.
